BATCH FILES RENAME
This program lets you rename all the files in folder with a custom name and a extension and a number in the name
(BEWARE THIS CANNOT BE UNDO'ED)
(This also includes a system to create files. So I suggest to try out the program using that)

USAGE: 
1. Add the directory path
2. Provide a name for the files
   Provide extension with the name if you want to change the extension(if not provided, existing extension will be used)
3. Provide the staring number for renaming(eg- If 3 is provided the first file will have the number 3 and so on)
4. Press "Start"

Note:
If no name or number is provided, the file names be only numbers and have .txt extension
The program wont work if the folder path doesn't exist
This program with rename file according to the respective place in the folder i.e., First file will have name 1 and so on
